a simple character battle game -- learning .py class usage.

I wrote this in an hour, while learning classes in python.
A future game could be had here. Adding the abilities to add and choose characters, verbal interactions, fight locations, spoils of war or competition fights, utilizing the speed  and damage in fight calculations, even adding custom cards you can win or purchase that are assigned to your character and can be played in a battle.
